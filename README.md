# 🏥 Prediction of Disease Outbreak  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **Disease Outbreak Prediction System** that leverages **machine learning** to predict the likelihood of diseases such as **Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease** based on user input. The system is built using **Streamlit** for the user interface and **scikit-learn** for machine learning model implementation.

## 🚀 Features  
- 🏥 **Predicts three diseases:**  
  - 🟠 **Diabetes**  
  - ❤️ **Heart Disease**  
  - 🟢 **Parkinson's Disease**  
- 📊 **Interactive Web Interface:** Built with **Streamlit** for ease of use.  
- 📉 **Data Visualization:** Uses **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for insightful visualizations.  
- ⚡ **Fast and Lightweight:** Runs efficiently using **scikit-learn** models.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **NumPy** – Data processing  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization  
- **Seaborn** – Advanced visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models  
- **Streamlit** – Web application framework

## 🏥 Disease Prediction Models  
### **1️⃣ Diabetes Prediction**  
Takes input such as glucose level, BMI, insulin, and more to predict diabetes.  

### **2️⃣ Heart Disease Prediction**  
Uses features like **age, cholesterol, blood pressure, chest pain type** to predict heart disease.  

### **3️⃣ Parkinson’s Disease Prediction**  
Uses **voice-related biomarkers** to detect Parkinson’s disease.
